Implement `GaussianDiffusion.p_sample` method by following Equation (6) from the paper. This equation describes sampling from the posterior of the forward process, conditioned on $x_t$ and $x_0$, where $x_0$ can be derived from the denoising model's output. We have already implemented `sample` method that iteratively calls `p_sample` to generate images from input texts.\n","\n","Test your implementation of `p_sample` below, you should see relative errors less than 1e-6.\n","\n","$$\n","p_\\theta(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t) =\n","\\mathcal{N}\\left(\n","x_{t-1} \\; ; \\;\n","\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\; \\sigma_t^2 \\mathbf{I}\n","\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","> üîé **Reference:** Consult the original DDPM paper[1] around **Equation (6)** (posterior mean/variance)\n","> and **Equation (11)** (reparameterization using the model prediction)."],"metadata":{"id":"RZTFsGpK7wiV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["np.random.seed(231)\n","torch.manual_seed(231)\n","\n","dim = 4\n","condition_dim = 4\n","dim_mults = (2,)\n","unet = Unet(dim=dim, condition_dim=condition_dim, dim_mults=dim_mults)\n","\n","h = w = 4\n","b = 1\n","inp_x_t = torch.randn(b, 3, h, w)\n","inp_model_kwargs = {\"text_emb\": torch.randn(b, condition_dim)}\n","t = 231\n","\n","# test 1\n","diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(\n","      model=unet,\n","      image_size=h,\n","      timesteps=1000,\n","      beta_schedule=\"sigmoid\",\n","      objective=\"pred_x_start\",\n",")\n","out = diffusion.p_sample(inp_x_t, t, inp_model_kwargs).detach().numpy()\n","expected_out = np.array(\n","    [[[[ 1.1339471 ,  0.12097352, -0.7175048 ,  1.3196243 ],\n","         [-0.27657282,  0.4899886 ,  1.0170169 , -0.8242867 ],\n","         [-0.18946372,  0.9899801 ,  0.01498353,  0.39722288],\n","         [-0.97995025, -0.5947938 , -0.07796463, -0.07311387]],\n","\n","        [[ 0.0739838 , -1.5537696 ,  0.43128064, -0.7395982 ],\n","         [-1.0517508 , -1.7030833 ,  0.79073197, -1.217138  ],\n","         [-0.5314434 ,  0.9862699 ,  0.6568664 , -0.4559122 ],\n","         [-0.17322278,  0.51251256, -0.75741345, -0.3967054 ]],\n","\n","        [[ 0.8546979 ,  1.6186953 ,  1.9930652 ,  0.57347   ],\n","         [ 0.20219846,  0.5374655 , -0.81597316,  1.9089762 ],\n","         [ 0.7327057 ,  1.19275   ,  1.8593936 , -1.4582647 ],\n","         [ 0.68447256, -0.9056745 ,  0.7863245 ,  0.14455058]]]])\n","forward_error = rel_error(out, expected_out)\n","print(\"forward error: \", forward_error)\n","if forward_error < 1e-6 : print(\"Passed!
